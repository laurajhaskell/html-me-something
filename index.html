                    <h2>Colombia</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>November 2017 - My best friend growing up has been teaching English as a second language in Periera, Colombia for over a year. I figured the best time to go was when I had a free, spanish speaking travel guide, so I found a cheap flight on Thanksgiving day and stuffed as much of my life as I could in my backpack.</p>

                    <h2>Colombia: Salento</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>A quick one hour bus ride from Periera, you will find the unique town of Salento. The landsacpe was not like anything I have seen with rolling hills topped with 200ft high tall palm trees and sprinkled with free-roaming horses and cows.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The best way to travel into the valley is by open jeep. No seatbelts. No waviers signed. And the drivers encourage riders to stand on the metal grate attached to the back for the best view and full effect of the rolling hills. May not have been the smartest decision in my life, but I would do it again in a hearbeat.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>To dive deep into the rich culture, we travelled to Colombia's second largest city Medellin. Here the food is amazing and art is everywhere. Local artists were comissioned to cover entire neighborhoods with murals creating widly colorful buildings as far as the eye can see.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Last stop was a small beach town accessable by small boat only. By small boat I mean wooden boat with no sides, which was very unfortunate as we got 5-feet of air and crashed through waves. Unlike most beaches, we walked on black sand with an overcast sky and constant light mist.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>February 2018 - Lately I have found my friends in spanish speaking countries. Unfortunately my spanish has not improved, but I have taken full advantage of free places to stay and travel buddies. Fast forward to Valentine's day and I am traveling to visit a friend au pairing for a family in Spain.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>A must when in Barcelona is to walk up a very steep and longer than anticipated hill to embrace the work of famous Spanish arcitect, Antoni Gaudi. Park Guell showcases Gaudi's organic and colorful pallette with a phenomal view of city in the background.</p>

                    <p>Another must is to go into Gaudi's catherdal, famous for still being unfinished after five generations. Luckily we picked the golden hour to go inside when the intricate stained glass refleced off the walls. </p>

                    <p>To experience Spain how Spainards do, we took train to Zaragoza and stayed with the family she was au pairing for. The language barrier did not effect the family's warm hospitality. Nights of chatting were topped off with a warm cup of chocolate and churros.</p>

                    <p>February 2018 - Since we were both already in Europe and not ready to leave, we decided to go somewhere new and hoped on a flight to Italy.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>The first sight when walking up from the underground metro in Milan did not disappoint. We were very surprised and impressed by the view of Italy's largest church, Duomo di Milano.</p>

                    <p>A quarter-turn to the left is the equally impressive block of shops, Quadrilatero d'Oro. We accepted the fact that nothing in these beautiful stores will ever be in our price range, but still fun to window shop and people watch regradless.  </p>

                    <p> We found the best snack for when your feet are hurting from walking miles trying to fiting in as much as possible. Also makes a good breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>After a train ride four hours in the wrong direction, we successfully made it to our day trip destination of Lake Como. With summer being the busiest season, we had to quiet water-front towns to ourselves while exploring.</p>
